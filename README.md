[How to Listen via Podcast Guru](Tutorials/Podcast-Guru.md)


# To Do items
- [ ] Include links for Sats Worthy Songs to open directly in various podcast players (want to avoid this just leading to listening without connecting a wallet and supporting the independant artists)
- [ ] Create a guide for picking a default streaming amount and a default Boost amount
- [ ] Create a tutorial for Podverse
- [ ] Create a tutorial for Fountain
- [ ] Create guides for listeners on how to get wallets setup
- [x] Create a tutorial for Podcast Guru

# Tools used
- Used https://www.thesplitkit.com to pick the songs I wanted and make the chapters and value time splits
- Used https://sovereignfeeds.com for a real nice GUI to make additional modifications to the RSS feed
- Using a combination of https://getalby.com and https://conshax.app to receive sats and track listener statistics
- Added https://op3.dev/e/ to the beginning of the episode URL for open source listening statistics through https://op3.dev/
