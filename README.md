# Sats-Worthy-Songs
Home of the RSS feed of the Sats Worthy Songs podcast. A collection of playlists containing value for value (V4V) music. 

Feel free to suggest changes to the RSS feed and documentation via pull requests.

# To Do items
- [ ] The end goal is throughout the entire episode, for 95% of the sats to go to the artists, with the rest getting spread to some of the tools making this happen. Currently there are too many situations where the boosts are going to me and not the artists. This needs a solution.
- [ ] Include links for Sats Worthy Songs to open directly in various podcast players (want to avoid this just leading listeners listening through the link without connecting a wallet)
- [ ] Include guides for listeners on how to get wallets setup.

# Tools used
- [x] Used https://www.thesplitkit.com to pick the songs I wanted and make the chapters and value time splits
- [x] Used https://sovereignfeeds.com for a real nice GUI to make additional modifications to the RSS feed
- [x] Using a combination of https://getalby.com and https://conshax.app to receive sats and track listener statistics
- [x] Added https://op3.dev/e/ to the beginning of the episode URL for open source listening statistics through https://op3.dev/
