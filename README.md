# To Do items
- [ ] The end goal is throughout the entire episode, for 95% of the sats to go to the artists, with the rest getting spread to some of the tools making this happen. Currently there is too many situations where tbe boosts are going to the show and not the artists. This needs a solution.
- [ ] Include links to the podcast to various podcast players
- [ ] Include guides for listeners on how to get wallets setup.
