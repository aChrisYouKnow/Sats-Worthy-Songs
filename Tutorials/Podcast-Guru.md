8. Enter a name. You can use any name, and change it at any time. For the artists, its more satisfying to see lots of different people streaming value instead of everyone keeping 'Anonymous' for their name

9. Set your default Boost Amount and Stream Rate. These can be adjusted independently for each podcast/artist as well. Stream rate is the amount per minute that will go to the artists or podcast while you're listening. The Boost button is an additional one-time payment that can be sent with or without a message to the artist in addition to the streaming rate. 
   For help deciding on your default values, see: (Add Link Later)

16. In the chapters list, you can click any song and go directly to it. Useful for skipping past a song you're not as into, or for getting to a song you really like quickly

20. Here you can choose whether or not you get notified of new episodes, if new episodes auto-download, if you want to use a different boost amount or stream rate here instead of your default values, and if you want sats streaming to start by default without turning it on each time. I would recommend turning on 'Stream sats when playing' so you don't have to manually turn it on each time.
